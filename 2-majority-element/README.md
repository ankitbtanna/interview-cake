# Majority element
* Write a function which takes an array and prints the majority element (if it exists)
* otherwise prints “No Majority Element”.
* A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times 
* (and hence there is at most one such element). 

## Example 1
**Input**: [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
**Output**: 4
**Explanation**: The frequency of 4 is 5 which is greater than the half of the size of the array size. 

## Example 2
**Input**: [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4]
**Output**: No Majority Element
**Explanation**: There is no element whose frequency is greater than the half of the size of the array size.
