# Note
- Good way to practice these algorithms is to only use .length properties and practice push pop assign and deletion operations
- It is good to visualize all the problems first
- Try to draw boxes and arrows
- Then program it
- It's a core competency that will be useful for the rest of the life

# Linear Search
- Simplest form of algorithm
- Everyone has to do a certain kind of search
- Simplest search is a Linear search
- Try and whiteboard the solutions always
- What does indexOf method do? Which algorithm does it use?
- It uses linear search

# What is the Big O?
- Important concepts to remember here
    - Growth is w.r.t. input
    - Constants are dropped
    - Consider always the worst case
- What is the possible worst case situation?
    - If the thing that we are searching for, does not exist.
    - We go till the end of an array
    - it is O(n)
